      "abstract    &  Abstract Clustering is an essential data mining tool that aims to discover inherent cluster structure in data. For most applications, applying clustering is only appropriate when cluster structure is present. As such, the study of clusterability, which evaluates whether data possesses such structure, is an integral part of cluster analysis. However, methods for evaluating clusterability vary radically, making it challenging to select a suitable measure. In this paper, we perform an extensive comparison of measures of clusterability and provide guidelines that clustering users can reference to select suitable measures for their applications. &  Abstract We introduce admissible group actions on cluster algebras, cluster categories and quivers with potential and study the resulting orbit spaces. The orbit space of the cluster algebra has the structure of a generalized cluster algebra. This generalized cluster structure is different from those introduced by Chekhov–Shapiro and Lam–Pylyavskyy. For group actions on cluster algebras from surfaces, we describe the generalized cluster structure of the orbit space in terms of a triangulated orbifold. In this case, we give a complete list of exchange polynomials, and we classify the algebras of rank 1 and 2. We also show that every admissible group action on a cluster category induces a precovering from the cluster category to the cluster category of orbits. Moreover this precovering is dense if the categories are of finite type. \\\\\n",

       "      <td>Abstract The objective of clustering ensemble is to find the underlying structure of data based on a set of clustering results. It has been observed that the samples can change between clusters in different clustering results. This change shows that samples may have different contributions to the detection of the underlying structure. However, the existing clustering ensemble methods treat all sample equally. To tackle this deficiency, we introduce the stability of a sample to quantify its contribution and present a methodology to determine this stability. We propose two formulas accord with this methodology to calculate sample's stability. Then, we develop a clustering ensemble algorithm based on the sample's stability. With either formula, this algorithm divides a data set into two classes: cluster core and cluster halo. With the core and halo, the proposed algorithm then discovers a clear structure using the samples in the cluster core and assigns samples in the cluster halo to the clear structure gradually. The experiments on eight synthetic data sets illustrate how the proposed algorithm works. This algorithm statistically outperforms twelve state-of-the-art clustering ensemble algorithms on ten real data sets from UCI and six document data sets. The experimental analysis on the case of image segmentation shows that cluster cores discovered by the stability are rational.</td>\n",

This study found that higher priced restaurant segments have stronger clusters than lower priced restaurants, which implies that restaurants that focus on hedonic values tend to cluster more than utilitarian focused restaurants. However, the results differ depending on whether or not restaurants are located within a central business district (CBD). For example, quick service restaurants have stronger clusters than casual restaurants outside CBDs. Practical applications may apply to new restaurants that are attempting to open. Up-scale restaurants have the advantage of reducing research costs by locating near similar restaurants. Moreover, casual restaurants do benefit by clustering near existing ones under the condition that demand is not severely hurt by competition, while quick service restaurants benefit by diffusing from each other.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Abstract Expert and intelligent systems use a variety of machine learning techniques to obtain and understand the information inherent in the data. Clustering is one of these techniques, which has become important and popular since it allows classifying an unlabeled dataset into clusters of similar objects. There are many clustering algorithms that have been proposed in the literature. From these algorithms, the Cross-Clustering algorithm is one of the most recent clustering algorithms for partial clustering (clustering where not necessarily all the objects are grouped into clusters), which has provided good results allowing estimating a suitable set of clusters, as well as eliminating outliers. However, this algorithm tends to eliminate too many objects as outliers, which leads to discard a lot of non-outlier objects. Additionally, the Cross-Clustering algorithms spends a lot of time evaluating several combinations of clusterings, trying to determine a suitable number of clusters. To overcome these problems, in this paper, an improved version of the Cross-Clustering algorithm (ICC) is proposed. ICC changes the clustering algorithm used for detecting outliers, as well as it modifies the way outliers are detected. Moreover, a stop criterion allowing to make a fast decision on the estimation of a suitable number of cluster, is also introduced. The performance of the improved Cross-Clustering algorithm is compared with the original algorithm on artificial and real datasets. Our results show that ICC improves the original algorithm and other state of the art clustering algorithms; in both, runtime and clustering quality.</td>\n",

       "0           Abstract Clustering is an essential data mining tool that aims to discover inherent cluster structure in data. For most applications, applying clustering is only appropriate when cluster structure is present. As such, the study of clusterability, which evaluates whether data possesses such structure, is an integral part of cluster analysis. However, methods for evaluating clusterability vary radically, making it challenging to select a suitable measure. In this paper, we perform an extensive comparison of measures of clusterability and provide guidelines that clustering users can reference to select suitable measures for their applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "1           Abstract We introduce admissible group actions on cluster algebras, cluster categories and quivers with potential and study the resulting orbit spaces. The orbit space of the cluster algebra has the structure of a generalized cluster algebra. This generalized cluster structure is different from those introduced by Chekhov–Shapiro and Lam–Pylyavskyy. For group actions on cluster algebras from surfaces, we describe the generalized cluster structure of the orbit space in terms of a triangulated orbifold. In this case, we give a complete list of exchange polynomials, and we classify the algebras of rank 1 and 2. We also show that every admissible group action on a cluster category induces a precovering from the cluster category to the cluster category of orbits. Moreover this precovering is dense if the categories are of finite type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "2           Abstract The objective of clustering ensemble is to find the underlying structure of data based on a set of clustering results. It has been observed that the samples can change between clusters in different clustering results. This change shows that samples may have different contributions to the detection of the underlying structure. However, the existing clustering ensemble methods treat all sample equally. To tackle this deficiency, we introduce the stability of a sample to quantify its contribution and present a methodology to determine this stability. We propose two formulas accord with this methodology to calculate sample's stability. Then, we develop a clustering ensemble algorithm based on the sample's stability. With either formula, this algorithm divides a data set into two classes: cluster core and cluster halo. With the core and halo, the proposed algorithm then discovers a clear structure using the samples in the cluster core and assigns samples in the cluster halo to the clear structure gradually. The experiments on eight synthetic data sets illustrate how the proposed algorithm works. This algorithm statistically outperforms twelve state-of-the-art clustering ensemble algorithms on ten real data sets from UCI and six document data sets. The experimental analysis on the case of image segmentation shows that cluster cores discovered by the stability are rational.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "3           Abstract This study tested whether geographic clustering differs by restaurant segment due to the differences in consumers’ hedonic and utilitarian values by using Ripley’s K function and a Tobit model. This study found that higher priced restaurant segments have stronger clusters than lower priced restaurants, which implies that restaurants that focus on hedonic values tend to cluster more than utilitarian focused restaurants. However, the results differ depending on whether or not restaurants are located within a central business district (CBD). For example, quick service restaurants have stronger clusters than casual restaurants outside CBDs. Practical applications may apply to new restaurants that are attempting to open. Up-scale restaurants have the advantage of reducing research costs by locating near similar restaurants. Moreover, casual restaurants do benefit by clustering near existing ones under the condition that demand is not severely hurt by competition, while quick service restaurants benefit by diffusing from each other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "4           Abstract Expert and intelligent systems use a variety of machine learning techniques to obtain and understand the information inherent in the data. Clustering is one of these techniques, which has become important and popular since it allows classifying an unlabeled dataset into clusters of similar objects. There are many clustering algorithms that have been proposed in the literature. From these algorithms, the Cross-Clustering algorithm is one of the most recent clustering algorithms for partial clustering (clustering where not necessarily all the objects are grouped into clusters), which has provided good results allowing estimating a suitable set of clusters, as well as eliminating outliers. However, this algorithm tends to eliminate too many objects as outliers, which leads to discard a lot of non-outlier objects. Additionally, the Cross-Clustering algorithms spends a lot of time evaluating several combinations of clusterings, trying to determine a suitable number of clusters. To overcome these problems, in this paper, an improved version of the Cross-Clustering algorithm (ICC) is proposed. ICC changes the clustering algorithm used for detecting outliers, as well as it modifies the way outliers are detected. Moreover, a stop criterion allowing to make a fast decision on the estimation of a suitable number of cluster, is also introduced. The performance of the improved Cross-Clustering algorithm is compared with the original algorithm on artificial and real datasets. Our results show that ICC improves the original algorithm and other state of the art clustering algorithms; in both, runtime and clustering quality.   \n",
